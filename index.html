      <p class="w3-lobster" style="font-size:50px;"><b>Working Experience</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Even before my Masters Degree's graduation in October, I have started to look for my first job. I still
         remember the excitement in preparing my resume, bringing out my creativity to the max to come out with a 
         decent template and filled it up with all the related information. I have sent out my resume with various job
         applications with satisfaction. I can recall that I applied for various position such as Business
         Analyst, Management Trainee for a few banks, Equity Analyst, Wealth Management Associate and Customer Services.
         However, there was totally no reply from any of the job applications, even though I have called to follow up.
         Fortunately, after 3 months of trying and waiting, I was able to land a job in OCBC Bank Sdn Bhd as part of the trade
         product management team in 2018.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>These are my jobscopes as a member in trade product management team :
        <ul>
          <li>Review trade products in annual basis unless a drastic change in features</li>
          <li>Monthly reporting to the senior management for monthly planning</li>
          <li>Data analysis on customer profiles from the reports prepared</li>
          <li>Plan, prepare and conduct campaigns for selected cluster of customers to maintain customer relationship</li>
          <li>Prepare memo for strategic adjustment related to businesses</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="w3-justify">I am really grateful as I was given a chance to learn something new in the team. It was a fruitful one
         since I joined the bank. Really appreciate the care and patience that my colleagues have given to me while
         guiding me throughout the days in the bank. However, I have never give up in pursing my goal that I want to
         be in part of the investment banking team, treasury team or equity research team. I believe that 
         I am ready to take on hurdles and challenges with my passion and knowledge. Thus, I would like to take
         one step forward in pursing my next career goal. Everyone has to start somewhere 
         to become an expert in a specific field. Don't you agree? </p>

      <p class="w3-lobster" style="font-size:50px;"><b>Achievements</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">I am always heated up while knowing that there is a challenge ahead, whether it is a learning
      or competition. I have participated in various conferences, trainings and competitions in past few years.
      I am always eager to pick up new skills which may benefit to my future career. This is also why I am able to
      create these webpages during MCO days. I have the opportunity to equip myself with Python and HTML programming. </p>
      <ul>
      <li>These are some of my achievements while working in the bank and during my uni days :
        <ul>
          <li>OCBC Bank Digithon (Champion-2019): Enhance seamless customer experience with trade and cash solution</li>
          <li>AI in Finance Course (2019): Selected by management to join the online learning conducted by Centre for Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship (CFTE)</li>
          <li>MBA Final Project (2018): A social responsibility project which is part of the programme, a project to help the underprivileged kids</li>
          <li>Certificate in the Malaysian Capial Market (2018): Course conducted by RAM Holdings Berhad regarding Malaysian Capital Market</li>
          <li>CIMB Data Science Challenge (3<sup>rd</sup> Runner-up-2016): A data science challenge opened to undergraduates nationwide.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="w3-justify">Unlike uni days, I do have time constraint in exploring skills that I wished to learn.
      Working overtime is a norm as everyone of us is busying with their job routine. However, this is not an excuse
      to stop us from picking up new skills set and gaining knowledge. Time management is important
      to get things done. If we fail to plan, then we are planned to fail.
